# MNIST-CNN-Digit-Recognizer

## Overview

MNIST-CNN-Digit-Recognizer is a deep learning project aimed at building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This project demonstrates the application of CNNs in image recognition tasks, providing an end-to-end solution for digit classification.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a CNN architecture tailored for image recognition.
- **MNIST Dataset**: Leverages the popular MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves high accuracy in digit recognition through effective model design and training techniques.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Includes data visualization, model performance metrics, and error analysis.
